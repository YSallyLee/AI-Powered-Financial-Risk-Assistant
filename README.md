# üõ°Ô∏è AI Fraud Detection Chatbot: A Guided Transaction Assistant

## üåü Project Overview

This project presents a prototype for an **AI-powered assistant chatbot** designed for the banking industry to enhance the user experience in reviewing transactions and detecting potential fraud.

The core idea is to move beyond passive fraud alerts by providing a guided, conversational interface.The chatbot reviews simulated user transaction data, flags unusual activity, and provides step-by-step guidance for verifying or reporting suspicious transactions

This system demonstrates the practical application of **Generative AI** in a high-stakes financial setting, acting as a "real" bank assistant and laying the foundation for a more advanced fraud-prevention system

## ‚ú® Features

* **Simulated Authenticated Environment**: The chatbot simulates a secure banking environment with a login feature and personalized responses
* **Gemini API Integration**: Uses **Google's Gemini API** to power the AI responses, enabling it to act in the voice of the bank (e.g., using "we" and "our system")
* **Transaction Review**: Helps users review their recent transactions and flag anything unusual
* **Guided Fraud Verification**: Guides users step-by-step through verifying or reporting suspicious activity
* **Interactive UI**: Built with **Python** and the **Streamlit** package for a clean, interactive user interface

## üíª Technology Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Framework/UI**: Streamlit
* **AI Model**: Google Gemini API

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

You need a Python environment and an API key for the Google Gemini API.

1.  **Get a Gemini API Key**: Obtain your key from Google AI Studio.
2.  **Set Environment Variable**: For security, set your API key as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repo-Link-Here]
    cd [Your-Repo-Directory]
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The application will open in your default web browser.

## üîÆ Future Development

This prototype demonstrates a strong proof-of-concept, but there is clear scope for further enhancement:

* **Real Database Integration**: Integrate a real SQL database instead of the current simulated dataset to handle actual banking transaction structures
* **Improved Conversational Flexibility**: Enhance the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to handle a broader range of general and financial queries, moving beyond only fraud-related questions
* **Visual AI Fraud Scoring**: Explore the integration of visual AI-driven fraud scoring for more robust detection
